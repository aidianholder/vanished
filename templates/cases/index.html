		    <p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Nobody knows exactly how many people have disappeared or been murdered in and around the Yakama reservation. </strong>The reservation is 1.3 million acres including some remote and wild country.  A legacy of poverty and racism means people don't talk to law enforcement.  Tribal police have limited authority; the FBI is supposed to investigate serious crimes but the Seattle field office can feel a long way away.  </p>
		    <p style="text-align: left;">During an FBI investigation spurred by rumors of a serial killer, investigators found 32 cases dating back to 1980.  The list has only gotten longer since then.  Our list is based on Yakima Herald-Republic archives, information from law enforcement sources, social media posts, and the stories of friends and relatives.  If you have information about one of these cases or you need to add a name to the list, email vanished@yakimaherald.com
